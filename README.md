This is an R code for drawing a combination of multi-layer rings and polygons, inspired by the paper "Nonlinear dynamics of multi-omics profiles during human aging" published in nature aging. Its author has provided R in the following link:

This is a code cluster that integrates multiple graphs, which is a difficulty for researchers who simply want to plot the multi-layer rings and polygons in it.
Therefore, this repository provides a new code to realize similar combinations of multi-layer circles and polygons. I encourage those using this code to use their own datasets, which are randomly generated in the code. 
Also, the colors and positions need to be meticulously and freely adjusted. A plot generated based on the randomized dataset is provided for reference.
